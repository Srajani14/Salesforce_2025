1. Problem Statement

Libraries face challenges in maintaining accurate records of book borrowing and returns. Manual record-keeping is time-consuming, error-prone, and may result in misplaced books, duplicate entries, or unnoticed overdue items. These inefficiencies increase the workload of librarians and reduce the overall user experience for students and readers. Therefore, there is a need for an automated, reliable, and user-friendly system to manage library operations effectively.
