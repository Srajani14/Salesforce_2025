Libraries often face difficulties in maintaining accurate records of book borrowing and returns. Manual record-keeping systems are time-consuming, prone to human errors, and may result in misplaced books, duplicate entries, or overdue books going unnoticed. These inefficiencies not only increase the workload for librarians but also reduce the overall user experience for students and readers. Therefore, there is a need for an automated, reliable, and user-friendly system to manage library operations effectively.
